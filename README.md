C++ project implementing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network for binary classification with customizable layers and learning rates. Includes core ML algorithms like forward and backpropagation with sigmoid activation, and gradient descent to update weights and biases with real-time visualizer that displays the network structure, neuron activations, and training progress, providing an interactive view of how the network learns.
